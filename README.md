# Moving Mouse Game

## Project Overview
*Moving Mouse* is a collaborative two-player game inspired by the popular PC game **Fireboy and Watergirl**. The game requires players to work together to overcome obstacles, collect objects, and reach the level checkpoint safely. Both players must strategize to complete each level using a shared set of three lives. If the players lose all lives, the game ends, but if they successfully complete the level, they advance to the next.

## Game Features
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Each level presents unique challenges that require coordination between players.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays when all lives are used up, allowing players to restart or exit.
- **Next Level Screen**: Appears when a level is completed successfully, with options to continue or quit.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Core language for logic and functionality.
- **Pygame**: Library for creating the game's interactive graphics and handling animations, player inputs, and object collisions.

## How to Run the Game
1. Ensure Python and Pygame are installed on your machine.
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory and run the main game file.
   ```bash
   cd MovingMouse
   python main.py
   ```

## Game Instructions
1. Use the keyboard to control the two characters, collaborating to avoid obstacles and reach the level checkpoint.
2. Work together to collect objects throughout each level to unlock new areas and gain points.
3. Track lives in the display boxâ€”remember, both players share three lives per level.

## Future Development
- Additional levels with increased difficulty
- Power-ups and bonuses for extra lives or level boosts
- Enhanced visuals and animations
- Audio effects for in-game events like lives lost or level completion
